## Project Scope
### Text Dataset Creation from Audio signal captured by smartphones
#### Telemetry data for smartphones
We connect our smartphone as an IoT device in MS Azure IoT Central app.
We read and send the data over telemetry from device to the mobile app for Preprocessing.
All the user data will be processed in their individual smartphones.
Machine Learning models will get trained locally to update/perform hyperparameter tuning in the cloud.

#### Audio Signal Acquisition and transformation to Natural Language and Natural Background of the environment


### Creating Tensorflow Model of Natural Language Processing module to detect mood swings of an individual from audio and text data
